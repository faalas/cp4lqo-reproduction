  "description": "Reproduction of the study by Liu, H., Giridhara, S., and Sabek, I., VLDB 2025 \n (https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~sabek/pdf/25_paper_cp4lqo.pdf) which presents a conformal prediction–based framework for verifiable learned query optimization. The original study formulates the verification of learned query optimizers (LQOs) as a conformal prediction problem, enabling probabilistic latency guarantees, runtime violation detection, and robustness under workload distribution shifts. The reproduction focuses on evaluating the CP-based latency bounds, runtime verification mechanisms, and CP-guided plan search across multiple learned query optimizers, including Balsa, Lero, and RTOS, using benchmark workloads such as JOB and TPC-H.",
